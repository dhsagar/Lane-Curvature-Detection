#Lane Curvature Detection Using Image Processing
This project is completed as a research internship under Computer Engineering Professorship
at Technische Universität Chemnitz. It is computer vision/image processing approach to detect lane curvature from highway video.

Lane curvature detection from the highway is one of the fundamental requirements

for both autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance (ADAS) based appli-
cations. Curvy lane is a crucial factor that plays a significant role in the increasing

number of road fatalities worldwide. Detection of the curvature radius of the lane

and providing a warning message for upcoming curvy road conditions have the po-
tential to improve driving safety. Proposed algorithm has been implemented in Python3
and evaluated on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ environment. It can detect and calculate
lane curvature as well as provide warning messages for curvy road conditions.

#Project Goal
Goals of this project are as follows:
• Detect lane from a video captured from the highway
• Detect and measure lane curvature
• Provide warning message in terms of curvy lane condition
• Evaluate the proposed method on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ environment
