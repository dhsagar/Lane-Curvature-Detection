# Lane Curvature Detection Using Image Processing
This project is completed as a research internship under Computer Engineering Professorship at Technische Universit√§t Chemnitz. It is computer vision/image processing approach to detect lane curvature from highway video. Lane curvature detection from the highway is one of the fundamental requirements for both autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance (ADAS) based applications. Curvy lane is a crucial factor that plays a significant role in the increasing number of road fatalities worldwide. Detection of the curvature radius of the lane and providing a warning message for upcoming curvy road conditions have the potential to improve driving safety. Proposed algorithm has been implemented in Python3 and evaluated on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ environment. It can detect and calculate lane curvature as well as provide warning messages for curvy road conditions.
